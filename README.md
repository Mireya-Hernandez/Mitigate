# Mitigating Disability 
The Mitigating of Disabilities project is one I developed in hopes that it would provide meaningful resourses to the community affected by a disabiliity. In this project which is in the format of a website contains diffent sections of key resouses I believe would be benifical to the community. These sections include networking, helping people with similar situations connet more easily, Programs would include activity like camps, afterschool programs and events centered arould people with disabilities, and Technology which would highlight the amazing technologies being used to help mitigate a persons disability in todays society. Last but not least would be a section on the awareness of distinctive disabilities because even when a person is not directly impacted by a disability it is part of society so everyone should be educated on topics regarding disabiliy which is one of the primary goals in the development of this project.
